      <p>Past</p>
      <p>
        Last year, between March and July, I completed the Northcoders
        Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. During the bootcamp, I learned
        the fundamentals of software development, including JavaScript, React,
        Node.js, and SQL. I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack
        applications and working in an agile environment.
      </p>

      <p>Present</p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am focused on creating personal projects to sharpen my
        skills and gain more practical experience. I'm continuously improving my
        expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies and am actively
        looking for opportunities to join a full-stack software engineering
        team. My goal is to contribute to real-world projects while
        collaborating with a dynamic group of professionals.
      </p>

      <p>Future</p>
      <p>
        My goal is to work in a collaborative environment where I can keep
        learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and build software that
        makes a difference. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities!
